Campaign unclear Info
- Campaign description does not sufficiently describe the service the message program is providing to the end user.

(new)
Rocket Geek LLC provides an account security SMS program for our website users.
The program delivers one-time passcodes and verification messages that help users securely create an account, verify login attempts (MFA), and complete password recovery.
Messages are sent only when the user requests or triggers a security action (registration, login verification, or password recovery).
No marketing or promotional messages are sent as part of this program. Message frequency varies by user request.
Msg & data rates may apply.
Reply STOP to opt out, HELP for help, or contact support@rocketgeek.org


Sample messages use case mismatch Info
- Sample message(s) use case does not match declared use case(s).

Opt-in workflow insufficient consent Info
- Opt-in workflow does not obtain sufficient consent



Campaign Workflow box:
Users opt in by entering their phone number on the Rocket Geek LLC registration or password recovery form and checking a box,
then confirmation button, review SMS policy, check another checkbox, press another confirmation button to receive
recurring SMS verification codes used only for account security.
Message frequency varies, typically 1–2 messages per login attempt.
Msg&data rates may apply. Reply HELP for help or email support@rocketgeek.org.
Reply STOP to opt out. Terms & Conditions: https://rocketgeek.org/terms-of-service.html
Privacy Policy: https://rocketgeek.org/privacy-policy.html

(reworked)
Users explicitly opt in on the Rocket Geek LLC registration or password recovery page by opening the SMS Policy modal.
In the modal, the user enters a US mobile number and reviews the SMS disclosures (account security use only,
message frequency varies based on user request, message and data rates may apply, STOP to opt out,
HELP for help, support@rocketgeek.orgcontact, and links to our Terms of Service section 3.1 and Privacy Policy).
The opt-in checkbox is unchecked by default and is separate from general Terms acceptance.
The “Accept SMS Messages” button remains disabled until the phone number is valid and the user checks the opt-in checkbox.
Only after the user clicks “Accept SMS Messages” is consent recorded and the phone number saved back to the form.
Closing the modal without accepting does not record consent.
We send no marketing or promotional texts; messages are limited to account security verification codes and password recovery.
Consent is not a condition of purchase.
